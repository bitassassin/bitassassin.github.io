    <p>Every single time that I build a new site, static or not, I am so grateful that I did not go into web design as a career. Even a site as simple as this, a blog, has, pretty much out of the box the most convoluted CSS imaginable. I even went with a theme that used a quite simple CSS layout…</p>

<p>Anyhow, it is here now. This blog is yet another reboot of bit by bit, a blog I tried to start years ago on <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. Since then, I have tried <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, and am now trying <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I have yet to really find a static site generator that finds that balance between the fine control of hand-written HTML and the ease of use and visual splendor of a CMS. Here’s hoping that this time I will make more than one post before ignoring the blog for a year or two and starting over.</p>

<p>Bit by Bit itself is supposed to be a channel for me to describe projects I am currently failing at, with some salt sprinkled in. Topics I may end up discussing can range from mundane anecdotes about learning Javascript to the vagaries of chairing a nonprofit hackerspace. In the end, at the very least, it is an exercise in writing, and a break from the normal routine of work-sleep-work-hack-work-sleep-hack-work-sleep-work.</p>

<p>If you are reading, neat.</p>
